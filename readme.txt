This is app created by me - Marcin Maciaszek a.k.a. marq
You can use it and share it if you want!!!

How to run this up:
1. Download Python v2.7
2. Install pip (should be already installed with Python)
3. Download files from git repo
4. Set up virtual environment - it is good practise
5. Run command in main directory of app: pip install -r requirement.txt
6. To run this app execute command in main directory of app: python manage.py runserver --host 0.0.0.0
7. Later DB setup will be added.
